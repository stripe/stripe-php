= Installation

I've updated this library to be PHP 5.3 > compliant and to use namespaces and autoloading instead of "require" statements.
Its a much more streamlined use of the library. Most of the API documentation is still valid - just use namespaced class references instead.

Obtain the latest version of the Stripe PHP bindings with:

    git clone https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php

To get started, use a PSR-0 compliant autoloader to load the library. You can use something like Symfony2 or ZF2 or the Packagist autoloader if you choose.

    use \Stripe\Stripe;

Simple usage looks like:

    <?php
    
    /* Stripe::setApiKey('d8e8fca2dc0f896fd7cb4cb0031ba249'); //if you included the namespace, like above */
    \Stripe\Stripe::setApiKey('d8e8fca2dc0f896fd7cb4cb0031ba249');
    
    //An array to represent a credit card
    $myCard = array('number' => '4242424242424242', 'exp_month' => 5, 'exp_year' => 2015);
    
    //Charge the card
    $charge = \Stripe\Charge::create(array('card' => $myCard, 'amount' => 2000, 'currency' => 'usd'));
    
    //See the result!
    echo $charge;
