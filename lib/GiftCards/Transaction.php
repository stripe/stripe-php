/**
 * A gift card transaction represents a single transaction on a referenced gift
 * card. A transaction is in one of three states, <code>confirmed</code>,
 * <code>held</code> or <code>canceled</code>. A <code>confirmed</code> transaction
 * is one that has added/deducted funds. A <code>held</code> transaction has
 * created a temporary hold on funds, which can then be cancelled or confirmed. A
 * <code>held</code> transaction can be confirmed into a <code>confirmed</code>
 * transaction, or canceled into a <code>canceled</code> transaction. A
 * <code>canceled</code> transaction has no effect on a gift card's balance.
 *
 * @property string $id Unique identifier for the object.
