/**
 * A Tax <code>Registration</code> lets us know that your business is registered to collect tax on payments within a region, enabling you to <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/tax">automatically collect tax</a>.
 *
 * Stripe doesn't register on your behalf with the relevant authorities when you create a Tax <code>Registration</code> object. For more information on how to register to collect tax, see <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/tax/registering">our guide</a>.
 *
 * Related guide: <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/tax/registrations-api">Using the Registrations API</a>
 *
 * @property string $id Unique identifier for the object.
 * @property string $object String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value.
 * @property int $active_from Time at which the registration becomes active. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.
 * @property string $country Two-letter country code (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2</a>).
 * @property \Stripe\StripeObject $country_options
 * @property int $created Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.

 * @property bool $livemode Has the value <code>true</code> if the object exists in live mode or the value <code>false</code> if the object exists in test mode.
