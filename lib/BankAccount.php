/**
 * These bank accounts are payment methods on `Customer` objects.
 *
 * On the other hand [External Accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts) are
 * transfer destinations on `Account` objects for [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/custom-accounts). They
 * can be bank accounts or debit cards as well, and are documented in the links
 * above.
 *
 * Related guide: [Bank Debits and Transfers](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/bank-debits-transfers).
 *
 * @property string $id Unique identifier for the object.
 * @property string $object String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value.
 * @property null|string|\Stripe\Account $account The ID of the account that the bank account is associated with.
 * @property null|string $account_holder_name The name of the person or business that owns the bank account.
 * @property null|string $account_holder_type The type of entity that holds the account. This can be either `individual` or `company`.
 * @property null|string $account_type The bank account type. This can only be `checking` or `savings` in most countries. In Japan, this can only be `futsu` or `toza`.
 * @property null|string[] $available_payout_methods A set of available payout methods for this bank account. Only values from this set should be passed as the `method` when creating a payout.
 * @property null|string $bank_name Name of the bank associated with the routing number (e.g., `WELLS FARGO`).
 * @property string $country Two-letter ISO code representing the country the bank account is located in.
 * @property string $currency Three-letter [ISO code for the currency](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts) paid out to the bank account.
 * @property null|string|\Stripe\Customer $customer The ID of the customer that the bank account is associated with.
 * @property null|bool $default_for_currency Whether this bank account is the default external account for its currency.
 * @property null|string $fingerprint Uniquely identifies this particular bank account. You can use this attribute to check whether two bank accounts are the same.
 * @property null|\Stripe\StripeObject $future_requirements Information about upcoming new requirements for the bank account, including what information needs to be collected.
 * @property string $last4 The last four digits of the bank account number.
 * @property null|\Stripe\StripeObject $metadata Set of [key-value pairs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.
 * @property null|\Stripe\StripeObject $requirements Information about the requirements for the bank account, including what information needs to be collected.
 * @property null|string $routing_number The routing transit number for the bank account.
 * @property string $status <p>For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isnâ€™t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If a transfer sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send transfers until the bank details are updated.</p><p>For external accounts, possible values are `new`, `errored` and `verification_failed`. If a transfer fails, the status is set to `errored` and transfers are stopped until account details are updated. In India, if we can't [verify the owner of the bank account](https://support.stripe.com/questions/bank-account-ownership-verification), we'll set the status to `verification_failed`. Other validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply.</p>
