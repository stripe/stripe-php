/**
 * The <code>Charge</code> object represents a single attempt to move money into your Stripe account.
 * PaymentIntent confirmation is the most common way to create Charges, but transferring
 * money to a different Stripe account through Connect also creates Charges.
 * Some legacy payment flows create Charges directly, which is not recommended for new integrations.
 *
 * @property string $id Unique identifier for the object.
 * @property string $object String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value.
 * @property int $amount Amount intended to be collected by this payment. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#zero-decimal">smallest currency unit</a> (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts">equivalent in charge currency</a>. The amount value supports up to eight digits (e.g., a value of 99999999 for a USD charge of $999,999.99).
 * @property int $amount_captured Amount in cents (or local equivalent) captured (can be less than the amount attribute on the charge if a partial capture was made).
 * @property int $amount_refunded Amount in cents (or local equivalent) refunded (can be less than the amount attribute on the charge if a partial refund was issued).
 * @property null|Application|string $application ID of the Connect application that created the charge.
 * @property null|ApplicationFee|string $application_fee The application fee (if any) for the charge. <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees">See the Connect documentation</a> for details.
 * @property null|int $application_fee_amount The amount of the application fee (if any) requested for the charge. <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees">See the Connect documentation</a> for details.
 * @property null|string $authorization_code Authorization code on the charge.
 * @property null|BalanceTransaction|string $balance_transaction ID of the balance transaction that describes the impact of this charge on your account balance (not including refunds or disputes).
 * @property StripeObject $billing_details
 * @property null|string $calculated_statement_descriptor The full statement descriptor that is passed to card networks, and that is displayed on your customers' credit card and bank statements. Allows you to see what the statement descriptor looks like after the static and dynamic portions are combined. This value only exists for card payments.
 * @property bool $captured If the charge was created without capturing, this Boolean represents whether it is still uncaptured or has since been captured.
 * @property int $created Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.
 * @property string $currency Three-letter <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html">ISO currency code</a>, in lowercase. Must be a <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/currencies">supported currency</a>.
 * @property null|Customer|string $customer ID of the customer this charge is for if one exists.
 * @property null|string $description An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users.
 * @property bool $disputed Whether the charge has been disputed.
 * @property null|BalanceTransaction|string $failure_balance_transaction ID of the balance transaction that describes the reversal of the balance on your account due to payment failure.
 * @property null|string $failure_code Error code explaining reason for charge failure if available (see <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/error-codes">the errors section</a> for a list of codes).
 * @property null|string $failure_message Message to user further explaining reason for charge failure if available.
 * @property null|StripeObject $fraud_details Information on fraud assessments for the charge.
 * @property null|Invoice|string $invoice ID of the invoice this charge is for if one exists.
 * @property null|StripeObject $level3
 * @property bool $livemode Has the value <code>true</code> if the object exists in live mode or the value <code>false</code> if the object exists in test mode.
 * @property StripeObject $metadata Set of <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata">key-value pairs</a> that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.
 * @property null|Account|string $on_behalf_of The account (if any) the charge was made on behalf of without triggering an automatic transfer. See the <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers">Connect documentation</a> for details.
 * @property null|StripeObject $outcome Details about whether the payment was accepted, and why. See <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/declines">understanding declines</a> for details.

 * @property null|Review|string $review ID of the review associated with this charge if one exists.
 * @property null|StripeObject $shipping Shipping information for the charge.

For details about the payment method used for this charge, refer to <code>payment_method</code> or <code>payment_method_details</code> instead.
 * @property null|string|Transfer $source_transfer The transfer ID which created this charge. Only present if the charge came from another Stripe account. <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges">See the Connect documentation</a> for details.

 * @property null|string $statement_descriptor_suffix Provides information about a card charge. Concatenated to the account's <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#static">statement descriptor prefix</a> to form the complete statement descriptor that appears on the customer's statement. If the account has no prefix value, the suffix is concatenated to the account's statement descriptor.

 * @property null|string|Transfer $transfer ID of the transfer to the <code>destination</code> account (only applicable if the charge was created using the <code>destination</code> parameter).
 * @property null|StripeObject $transfer_data An optional dictionary including the account to automatically transfer to as part of a destination charge. <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/connect/destination-charges">See the Connect documentation</a> for details.
 * @property null|string $transfer_group A string that identifies this transaction as part of a group. See the <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#transfer-options">Connect documentation</a> for details.
